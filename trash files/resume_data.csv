I found that they performed slightly better than conven- tional methods, such as binary decision trees, in my preliminary results. • I administered two Linux GPU computing servers. My duties included managing user accounts, data, hardware, and software on these systems. • I worked on statistically interpreting an event-by-event classifier (e.g., a CNN) to calculate the sensitivity of the method and confidence intervals. • I gained experience working with photomultiplier tubes and dig- itizers for a muon detection project. May 2019— Project: Neutrino Physics REU July 2019 Where: Duke University, Durham, NC Advisor: Kate Scholberg Contributions: • I looked for candidates for neutrino detector materials based on their charged–current interaction energy thresholds. • I found two isotopes, 181Ta and 160Gd, that have desirable prop- erties. I ran preliminary calculations for interaction cross sec- tions and event rates, greenlighting further study. May 2018— Project: Experimental Nuclear Structure REU August 2018 Where: Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN Advisor: Joseph Hamilton Contributions: • Using double and triple coincidence counting, I measured the frequency at which 252Cf spontaneously fissions into certain iso- topes. I performed these measurements for two separate element pairs, tellurium–palladium and strontium–neodymium. • I tabulated my results into yields matrices, finding that the most common number of neutrons evaporated during these de- cays was 3 or 4, with immeasurably small yields at about 6+ neutrons. This is evidence that a previously studied case, that of barium–molybdenum, is unique since it has an unusually high probability of evaporating between 7 and 10 neutrons. Teaching January 2017— Position: Learning Assistant December 2019 Where: Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Alabama I worked as an undergraduate teaching assistant in introductory physics courses from the spring of my freshman year until my se- nior year. I assisted with labs, proctored exams, and sometimes presented extra credit problems for the classes. Publications • Brooks M.

Even though many elements from the book were dropped, such as the duchess with the baby pig and mock turtle, this version is without a doubt the most famous Alice adaption made. other information Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of no- blesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social posi- tion, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitle- ment, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a “poky little house,” and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged. Alice Adventurer � 26 November 1865 � United Kingdom � +39 0325658974 � http://en.wikipedia.org @ alice@wonderland.com About me Alice is a sensible prepubescent girl from a wealthy English family who finds herself in a strange world ruled by imag- ination and fantasy. Alice feels com- fortable with her identity and has a strong sense that her environment is comprised of clear, logical, and consistent rules and features. Alice’s familiarity with the world has led one critic to describe her as a ""disembodied intellect"". Alice dis- plays great curiosity and attempts to fit her diverse experiences into a clear understanding of the world.

Sections and subsections will appear in the PDF bookmarks. Note the CamelCase command names. ■ Use \Entry, \BulletItem, \SubBulletItem, \Item, \SubItem, \NumberedItem, etc., to create entries in the main body of the CV. ■ Enclose entry details between \begin{Detail} and \end{Detail} so that they are typeset in a smaller font. This is an example of entry detail text enclosed in a Detail environment. ■ Use \Gap and \BigGap to insert vertical spaces between entries to improve layout. THIS IS ANOTHER SUBSECTION This is a plain \Entry, followed by an \hfill and a date range Oct 2015 – Dec 2015 ■ This is a \BulletItem. This is an \Item, which has no bullet. Note the alignment with the \BulletItem above. ● This is a \SubBulletItem. This is a \SubItem, which has no bullet. Note the alignment with the \SubBulletItem above. [42] This is a \NumberedItem. Change the value of the macro \MaxNumberedItem to adjust the indentation width. LINE, PARAGRAPH, AND PAGE BREAKS ■ To create a new line within the same paragraph (i.e., preserving the same paragraph indentation), use \newline instead of \\; the latter will reset the paragraph indentation. ■ To create a new paragraph, use \par or simply leave an empty line. Paragraph indentations (from \Entry, \BulletItem, \SubBulletItem, \Item, \SubItem, \NumberedItem, etc.) do not carry across different paragraphs. ■ To create a new page, use \newpage. DATES ■ Use the following macros to specify and display dates consistently: ● \DatestampYMD{yyyy}{MM}{dd} (e.g., \DatestampYMD{2008}{01}{15}) ● \DatestampYM{yyyy}{MM} (e.g., \DatestampYM{2008}{01}) ● \DatestampY{yyyy} (e.g., \DatestampY{2008}) ■ Change the date format option passed to the document class to adjust how dates are displayed throughout the document: ● MMMyyyy (“Jan 2008”) ● ddMMMyyyy (“15 Jan 2008”) ● MMMMyyyy (“January 2008”) ● ddMMMMyyyy (“15 January 2008”) ● yyyyMMdd (“2008-01-15”) ● yyyyMM (“2008-01”) ● yyyy (“2008”) [CV compiled on 2019-11-13 for Acme Corporation] Page 3 of 3 ",9

Analog circuit, High speed design, Instrumentation for Particle detector 2009–2013 BE, G H R C E, Nagpur, 73.09%. Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Power Master thesis title Design and characterization of discrete analog front-end for resistive plate chamber (RPC) detector supervisors Dr. Aniruddhan Sankaran, Dr. Anil Prabhakar description Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) detector gives nanosecond electrical pulses with a few millivolts of amplitude at 50 Ohm termination impedance. For accurate timing data abstraction using a precision TDC, it is required to have a very accurate front-end with lowest possible time-walk and jitter in the output signal. Thesis emphasis on design of high gain broadband amplifier, and to characterize CFD with varying delays to get best possible slope on both rising edge and falling edge of signal for precision time measurement. A 0.35 ns improvement over 1.55ns of leading edge discriminator was obtained by use of ARCD topology and ac coupling for fast return to zero.

89,"  Personlighet Jag har bott på många olika ställen i mitt liv bl.a. 2 år i Berlin, Tyskland och i Köpenhamn, Danmark. Även i Filippinerna har jag bott under totalt 14 månader. Detta gör att jag har goda internationella erfarenheter med främmande kultu- rer. Man har lättare att anpassa sig till och förstå/respektera andra kulturer på ett annat sätt än vad man annars skulle ha gjort. Jag är politiskt aktiv i kultur- och fritidsnämnden vilket har varit mycket intres- santa erfarenheter speciellt med mitt starka intresse för samhällskunskap spe- ciellt inom EU politiken. Som person är jag målmedveten och arbetsam och gillar att lära mig nya saker och utmaningar.

Sc. Physics. Universität Bonn Main thematic priority of those master studies was numerical time series analysis of non- linear dynamical systems. Be- sides data analysis and transfor- mation, great importance was attached to fast algorithms and efcient software architecture. In the master thesis a numeri- cal approach for the detection of the direction of interaction was proposed. Analysis of this new approach was performed with the help computer simu- lations to fnd out its limits and to compare it to another com- monly used approaches. This numerical approach was highly optimised for cluster computing and implemented in c++ . For those purposes a dis- tributed computing cluster had to be set up and administrated. 2006 - 2009 B. Sc.
